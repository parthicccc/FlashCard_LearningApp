# FlashCard Learning App – Process Documentation

## 1. Problem Understanding

Students often face difficulty retaining concepts through traditional study methods. This project aims to create an **interactive flashcard-based learning app** that enhances active recall and self-testing. The app allows users to choose a topic, review flashcards, take quizzes, and receive instant feedback with scores.

---

## 2. Tech Approach & Tools Used

* **Framework:** Flutter (cross-platform mobile development using Dart)
* **Architecture:** Modular structure separating UI (screens), logic (state management with `setState()`), and data (`questions.dart`)
* **Navigation:** Flutter’s `Navigator` for screen transitions between quiz and result screens
* **UI Components:** Material Design widgets for a clean and consistent user interface
* **Data Handling:** Static question map containing topics, questions, answers, and scoring logic
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for version tracking and collaboration

## 3. Key Challenges & Learnings

* **State Management:**
  *Challenge:* Tracking question index, score, and selected answers without external packages.
  *Learning:* Leveraged Flutter’s built-in `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` for efficient local state updates.

* **Answer Randomization:**
  *Challenge:* Shuffling answers while correctly validating the selected choice.
  *Learning:* Implemented a controlled shuffle logic ensuring accurate answer mapping.

* **User Experience:**
  *Challenge:* Designing an intuitive flow with clear progress and transitions.
  *Learning:* Integrated linear progress indicators, animated answer buttons, and a results screen to improve engagement.

### **Outcome**

A functional, user-friendly flashcard learning application that promotes effective learning through quizzes and instant feedback. It serves as a scalable base for future educational Flutter projects.
